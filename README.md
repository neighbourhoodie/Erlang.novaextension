# Erlang Syntax for Nova

This repository includes a [Nova](https://nova.app) extension that gives you Erlang
syntax highlighting. While using this, I expect to add convenience snippets and other
useful things.

We mainly use this to develop [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org), if your
Erlang code-base looks significantly different, weâ€™re happy to accept patches for this.
